# data/

Runtime data UkoreHub's `core/` stores read and write — not code. See
`core/README.md` (`store.py`, `program_store.py`, `addon_store.py`) and
`core/extensibility/README.md` (`config_store.py`) for the classes that own
these files; this README is just what's on disk and whether it's shared.

**Working here:** don't open these files unless the task specifically needs
their current contents (e.g. debugging a stale value, checking a real id).
Never open an image file in here to "look at it" — there's nothing textual
to read, and it wastes context for zero benefit. Never confuse this with
`projects/` at the repo root, which is the actual gitignored workspace root
(real cloned repos) — see root `CLAUDE.md`; that one is never read at all
unless explicitly asked.

## JSON stores

- `projects.json` — `MetadataStore`, the Project/Repo registry.
  **Shared/git-tracked.** Can grow large as repos/thumbnails accumulate —
  prefer `programs.json`/`system_config.json` below if you just need "an
  example of the shape."
- `programs.json` — `ProgramStore`, the shared software catalog. Shared/
  git-tracked, small.
- `system_config.json` — `SystemConfigStore`, studio-wide settings (GitHub
  OAuth client id). Shared/git-tracked, tiny.
- `addon_settings.json` — `AddonMetadataStore`, studio-editable overrides
  layered on a discovered add-on's manifest (icon, description, required
  Program). Shared/git-tracked.
- `local_config.json` — `LocalConfigStore`: workspace root, theme, active
  project/repo, recent files. **Gitignored, per-machine.**
- `projects.example.json` — a checked-in sample shape for `projects.json`,
  not read by the app itself.
- `plugins/studio/*.json`, `plugins/local/*.json` — `PluginConfigStore`
  files, one per `plugin_id` a plugin/add-on's `register(api)` chose.
  `studio/` shared/git-tracked, `local/` gitignored/per-machine — mirrors
  the same split as the top-level stores above.

## Binary/image directories — not code, skip unless verifying a specific file

- `thumbnails/` — per-repo thumbnail images, filename = `Repo.
  thumbnail_filename`.
- `program_icons/` — per-`Program` icons, filename = `Program.
  icon_filename`.
- `addon_icons/` — per-add-on icons, filename = `AddonMetadata.
  icon_filename`.

All three are referenced by filename from the JSON stores above; if a task
needs to confirm a file exists, check with a directory listing, not by
opening the image.
